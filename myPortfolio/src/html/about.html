        <p><b><i>The thing I remember the most about my school years was sports.  Working on getting better
            each day at football and basketball was a great feeling.  There were stretches where the day was 
            filled with these sports from before school, to lunch, after school, and then when we got kicked 
            out of the gym it was off to the park.

        <h3 class="titles">First Working Expirences</h3>
        <p><b><i>
            The first work I ever had was mowing my grandparents lawn each week.  Sure this was a small job
            with family but there was no easy day.  When I started driving the local supermarket was next in 
            line to give me real work expirences.  This would be the start of my retail life.  It started small
            as I worked my way up from sacker to checker then head stocker.

            Currently I work as a bus driver taking kids to school every morning.  This can be a very rewarding
            job at times and the most stressful the next second.
